# tick-tock-clocks-dashboard
A React app that displays various types of aesthetically pleasing and dope clocks! From analog and digital, to sunset clocks and word clocks...

## Ideas

### Sunset Clock 
- an aesthetic sunset-car-lofi-type-vibe with a sun and sky that moves and changes with the time of day
- the time is on the sun and moves and changes as the sun moves and changes
- sky changes colors over time as well
- sun turns into moon over time

### Word Clock:
 - clock that displays the time using words instead of numbers. Each word represents a specific time unit (e.g., "quarter past," "half past," "quarter to").
 - display actual time under it
